welcome to this doomed attempt at an ai where we  try to make it work
python libraries we need 
numpy(basically necessary if you are doing any math in python) 
pickle(comes in the standard python stuff)
basically possibly the 2 most essential python libruaries for ml
REMEMBER NOT EVERYTHING WORKS YET!!



Remember to notify others of changes before you make them in order to confirm whether they're needed or not
