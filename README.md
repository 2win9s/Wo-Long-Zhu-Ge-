welcome to this doomed attempt at an ai where we desperatly try to make it work

numpy(basically necessary if you are doing any math in python) 
pickle(comes in the standard python stuff)
REMEMBER NOT EVERYTHING WORKS YET!!



Remember to notify others of changes before you make them in order to confirm whether they're needed or not
