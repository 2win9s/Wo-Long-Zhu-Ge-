so in the folder T.A.N.N. in the file basicML.py i have backpropgation as a recursive process, will an iterative process be faster 
in this situaton?, is it possibe to make iterative?
also plenty of rookie mistakes bad practices and too many global variables but most of the code does what it is supposed to do
and how do you re-pickle a variable to get an updated version of it??
should we try make a visual out of how many gens have been completed in each run? (ive made it print "completed x runs" when its finished)
