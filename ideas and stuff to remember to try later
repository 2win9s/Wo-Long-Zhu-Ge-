give the a.i. an option to create new inputs by storeing pervious inputs that have been prevelant, the last set of inputs and recent inputs to simluate memeory
combine evolution algorithm and preLU and/or different output activation functions to determine the best one(impossible on school hardware because i doubt it can run one neural network nevermind 50)
come up with less computationally intensive ideas
linear for regression (predicting something/glorified calculator, giving a number as output)mean squared error
softmax for distribution/classification,(only when only one output is desired e.g. image recognition)cost cross entropy
sigmoid for distribution/classification,(only when multiple outputs are desires e.g. gaming,robotics)cost binary cross entropy
mean squared error is a safe way to just do it easily and efficiently but may not have the most desired peerformance
