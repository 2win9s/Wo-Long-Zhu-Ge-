We planned on modellinng data by using a simple feed-forward neural network,
in this type of neural network the input travels through the hiddenlayers and then to the output,
no information is retained between activations,this keeps the network simple.
example of s feed forward neural network with 2 neurons
let n be value of input neuron
n -----multiplied by a weight ------ add a bias ------ put into an activation function -------value of neuron in next layer
i.e.
f(x) = somefunction
nextlayerNeuron = f(n * weight + bias)
That is only what a 2 neuron neural network would look like in reality the new neuron recieves inputs from multiple neurons,
and there are multiple new neurons in the next layer.So it would look more like this
f(x) = somefunction
NextlayerNeuron[1] = f(n[1] * weight[1][1] + n[2] * weight[1][2]... + n[n] * weight[1][n] + bias)
NextlayerNeuron[2] = f(n[1] * weights[2][1] + n[2] * weight[2][1]... + n[n] * weight[2][n] + bias)
